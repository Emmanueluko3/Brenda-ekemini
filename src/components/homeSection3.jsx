          DevAsk is a community of coders built for all levels of techies. We
          thought of how most front end developers get stuck trying to identify
          a bug on a line of code thus wasting productive time. That’s why we
          came up with a community that allows other front end developers in the
          space to look through your code and debug in the shortest time
          possible
        </p>

        <p>
          Our product helps people find answers they need, whenever they need
          it. We help empower people by giving them a platform for them to feel
          accomplished and have a fun time. People ask questions, get replies
          and people also get paid, All in one platform.
